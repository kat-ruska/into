In Insurance Consulting we advise and provide solutions to insurance companies on the quantification and management of risk, and on wider operational capabilities, to provide competitive advantage in a rapidly-changing world. Our client base includes more than three-quarters of the world’s leading insurers across both life and property/casualty insurance.

The Role
***Please note that we do not accept multiple applications and you should select and apply to no more than one programme each year***

Salary: Competitive
A role in Insurance Consulting is stimulating, challenging, exciting and extremely rewarding.

We require associates who are technically and mathematically minded, with the ability to solve complex and challenging commercial problems using innovative and proportionate approaches.

As consultants, it is necessary to build a strong technical skill set but also the ability to communicate complex concepts to audiences from a variety of backgrounds. We deal with actuaries, accountants, underwriters, technologists, data scientists, insurance entrepreneurs, senior executives and other Board members. Each audience has different needs and knowledge and we need to tailor our communications to suit.

We are looking for candidates who are excellent in their own fields and are able and driven to apply their knowledge and skill sets to work with clients to support them in delivering their strategy and objectives.
What will I be doing day to day?

As a project-based advisory business, no two days are the same. Our graduates will experience this work variety immediately, and see this continue as their careers develop.

Graduates will tend to be involved in around 3 client projects at any one time, working on each with the support and guidance of an experienced consultant. You will be involved in regular project meetings which will help you to understand the business context and project objectives, and where your contribution fits in, as well as providing a space for you to report your progress.

You may also be involved in communicating with client stakeholders, working directly alongside clients or joining meetings/calls discussing progress or sharing deliverables.

A key difference at Willis Towers Watson is that we have our own set of Insurance Technology Solutions which are widely adopted within our client base. You will become familiar with these tools, and in demonstrating to or training clients, and in developing new propositions or solutions based on these tools.

Our graduates receive broad training during their first few months with Willis Towers Watson, which supplements a steep curve of on-the-job learning.

Career path and study support

The learning curve in the first few years is challenging as you grow your understanding of the insurance markets, our clients, products and propositions, whilst at the same time developing broader consulting skills and knowledge of actuarial techniques.

As you progress, you will get more deeply involved in supporting research and product development. We pride ourselves in remaining ahead of the game in our market – we need to know the next client issue or driver of change before it happens – and so we invest heavily in product and service development.

Information we collect

You can have a look through the site without giving us any of your personal information (though, as mentioned below, we do automatically collect certain information with respect to usage of our site).

E-mail address - We send a confirmation of your application by email. We may use e-mail or telephone to speak to you about similar vacancies unless you have asked us not to. We may also contact you by e-mail if you have only partially completed an application. But don’t worry. We won’t fill up your inbox with boring emails.
Contact telephone numbers - If there are any problems with your application, or we have to clarify anything with you, we need to be able to contact you quickly. Again, we certainly won’t call you for any other reason.

This template includes a question about any adjustments that may be required should you be invited for an interview or assessment.
Criminal records checks – For some roles, we might need to enquire about previous criminal convictions or carry out criminal records checks which are relevant to the role. If this is necessary, we’ll make you aware of this as early in the recruitment process as possible.
Sensitive personal information relating to your gender, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age bracket, details of any disability and sexual orientation is requested for the purpose of monitoring the effectiveness of our Equal Opportunities policy. This information is held in anonymous form and is not directly accessible by Jet.
Basic documentation checks. We are required by law to make basic documentation checks on every candidate.

Other relevant personal information specified during the online application process that is relevant to recruitment.

Cookies

Our sites use a number of different cookies. Below we explain the cookies we use and why we use them.

Cookies

What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that may be placed on your device when you visit our sites. When you next visit our sites, the cookie allows us to distinguish your device from other users.

There are two broad categories of cookies:

Persistent cookies
Persistent cookies remain on your device until deleted manually or automatically.
Session cookies
Session cookies remain on your device until you close your browser when they are automatically deleted.

Cookies we use and why we use them

Essential cookies
Essential cookies are technical cookies that are required for the operation of our sites. Without essential cookies our sites can’t operate properly. Essential cookies include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas.
Performance cookies
Performance cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors to our sites and to see how visitors move around them. This helps us to improve the way our sites work by enabling us to tailor our sites to the way visitors use them. The information we collect from performance cookies is aggregated which means that we cannot directly identify you from it.
Experience cookies
Experience cookies allow our sites to remember the choices you make. Our sites use experience cookies to provide you with enhanced and personalised features. For example, we use information collected through what are known as “web-analytic” cookies to compare the choices you make to those of our other users so that we can learn from those choices. Information collected by experience cookies cannot track your browsing activity when you leave our sites to browse other sites.
Marketing cookies
Marketing cookies record your visits to our sites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We use this information to make our sites and the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests. For example sometimes we use marketing cookies to limit the number of times that you see an advert. Sometimes we share information about your browsing activity, (which we have collected from cookies), with our advertising partners. They may use this information to advertise products, which may interest you, on other sites.

If you wish to opt-out of being re-targeted via display and search ads, and/or advertised to via cookies’ tracking, please click here to find out how to do so.

Why are we allowed to collect your information?

The reason depends on the particular activity we use your Information for. During the recruitment process, we will collect your Information if one of the following applies:

We need to use your Information to enable us to run our business successfully (the law calls it “legitimate interests”). This includes recruitment and hiring processes.
We can only do this if we can show that there is little or no risk to you or your personal information rights (see “Your Rights”)
We believe that our use of your personal information for recruiting purposes creates little or no risk to you or your rights but we want to be sure that you are happy for us to do it, so we will always ensure that we put you and your interests first.
We also make it easy for you to exercise your right to ask us to stop processing your application at any time– simply contact us at the address provided in the Your Rights section.
We need to use your information to comply with a law which we are subject to or we are legally obligated to do so. Where the law tells us that we need to use certain information, then we are allowed to do so, as long as we only use it for that purpose.
You have specifically given us your permission (the law calls it “consent”). Where we need your consent to use your personal information for a particular purpose, we must be able to show that the consent is:
Specific – we have to tell you exactly what activity your consent covers.
Informed – we have to provide you with clear details of what you are consenting to.
Freely given – you must have a genuine choice; for example, we couldn’t say “by registering for our free Wi-Fi, you consent to us sending you marketing emails” because that would prevent you from using the Wi-Fi service if you chose not to consent to marketing emails.
Unambiguous – this means that you must have clearly indicated your wishes by confirming your agreement to a statement (e.g. by ticking a box) or taking some positive action to show that you intended to give your consent.

We will need your consent for the following activities – we will always make it clear at the time:

Placing cookies on your device to find out how you use our websites so we can personalise what you see by tailoring advertisements and notifications to the things you are interested in
Using the location tracking function on your mobile device to enable location based services and advertising
Certain situations where you share sensitive Information about yourself, such as your health

Who we share the information with

We may share your information collected through cookies with advertisers and adverting networks so that we or they can show you relevant and interesting ads on and off our services. However, we do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed (e.g. 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their ad on any given day).

Processing by third parties

From time to time we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf or provide services to us including companies that operate our websites or candidate databases. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions / services, they will only use it for the purposes listed above, and they may not use it for other purposes. They must also process the personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.

International transfers

In order to carry out the steps set out above we may send your personal information outside of the European Economic Area and, if necessary, across international borders. The data protection laws in these countries may not be as comprehensive as in the European Economic Area. However, we have taken appropriate steps to make sure the same level of protection for the processing carried out in these countries as within the European Economic Area. Any details you provide may be electronically sent to the US to our parent company Walmart Inc., which helps us in running our websites. However, any such information will be dealt with in accordance with the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.

Storage of data

We will not store your personal information for any longer than we need to. However, we may be obliged by law to store your communications and personal information including activity logs and we may need to show details of these to government or authorised officials upon request. Like many websites, we use log files to monitor the effectiveness of our online marketing programmes.

How long do we keep your information?

Successful candidate information will be transferred onto their employee personnel record and will be held for the time they are employed by Jet and an additional 7 years once they leave the business.

Unsuccessful candidate information will be held for one year following the application to allow for the candidate to appeal the decision.

Potential candidates held with our candidate relationship management database will be retained for 12 months after the last contact and be given the opportunity through the process to remove their information if they choose to do so.

Your rights

You have a right to access the personal information that is held about you.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Amazon’s Consumer Reliability Engineering group (CRE) is looking for a Senior Software Development Engineer to join our team of talented software engineers to work on the development of an advanced proactive analytics platform focusing on Service-Oriented Architectures availability risks.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences. Ensuring a highly available experience is a massive challenge across 26 marketplaces’ websites & mobile-apps, powered by tens of thousands of backend services. Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

If you’re interested in a startup-like environment focused on building systems from the ground up that enable the analysis of complex and heterogeneous datasets; and the definition and execution of architectural improvements across all our software development groups, this is the place for you.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

Benefits;
We pay our engineers well.
We also provide you with benefits such as summer hours, flexible start times, pension, paid healthcare, tuition support, tax save travel, maternity and paternity leave, mentorships and more.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

We pay our engineers well.
We also provide you with benefits such as summer hours, flexible start times, pension, paid healthcare, tuition support, tax save travel, maternity and paternity leave, mentorships and more.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

We also provide you with benefits such as summer hours, flexible start times, pension, paid healthcare, tuition support, tax save travel, maternity and paternity leave, mentorships and more.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

We pay our engineers well.
We also provide you with benefits such as summer hours, flexible start times, pension, paid healthcare, tuition support, tax save travel, maternity and paternity leave, mentorships and more.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

We pay our engineers well.
We also provide you with benefits such as summer hours, flexible start times, pension, paid healthcare, tuition support, tax save travel, maternity and paternity leave, mentorships and more.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

We also provide you with benefits such as summer hours, flexible start times, pension, paid healthcare, tuition support, tax save travel, maternity and paternity leave, mentorships and more.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

What You’ll need?
You’ll be someone that has several years’ experience, developing UI applications at scale (for multi-million users).
That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).
UI work isn’t done in isolation - you’ve partnered with other teams to solve some complex and interesting, technical problems, at scale.
And you're used to working in Agile and finding your way around Jira.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences. Ensuring a highly available experience is a massive challenge across 26 marketplaces’ websites & mobile-apps, powered by tens of thousands of backend services. Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

Amazon’s Consumer Reliability Engineering group (CRE) is looking for a Senior Software Development Engineer to join our team of talented software engineers to work on the development of an advanced proactive analytics platform focusing on Service-Oriented Architectures availability risks.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences. Ensuring a highly available experience is a massive challenge across 26 marketplaces’ websites & mobile-apps, powered by tens of thousands of backend services. Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

If you’re interested in a startup-like environment focused on building systems from the ground up that enable the analysis of complex and heterogeneous datasets; and the definition and execution of architectural improvements across all our software development groups, this is the place for you.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences. Ensuring a highly available experience is a massive challenge across 26 marketplaces’ websites & mobile-apps, powered by tens of thousands of backend services. Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

If you’re interested in a startup-like environment focused on building systems from the ground up that enable the analysis of complex and heterogeneous datasets; and the definition and execution of architectural improvements across all our software development groups, this is the place for you.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

Amazon’s Consumer Reliability Engineering group (CRE) is looking for a Senior Software Development Engineer to join our team of talented software engineers to work on the development of an advanced proactive analytics platform focusing on Service-Oriented Architectures availability risks.

We are responsible for the global availability of the Amazon retail shopping experiences. Ensuring a highly available experience is a massive challenge across 26 marketplaces’ websites & mobile-apps, powered by tens of thousands of backend services. Multiply this width of scope with the depth of complexity introduced by the diversity of those services’ implementation choices, consumption of AWS’ services, frequent software updates, new feature launches, and you begin to get the picture.

To support the growth of complexity while strengthening our culture of resilient software engineering across all of Amazon’s consumer SDEs, we are expanding our data analytics team in Dublin which ensures that application software, supporting services, and underlying infrastructure components are resilient to failures. We ingest and analyze performance metrics from thousands of mission-critical services in order to identify and address latent bottlenecks that could lead our Customers to be impacted under overload conditions.

If you’re interested in a startup-like environment focused on building systems from the ground up that enable the analysis of complex and heterogeneous datasets; and the definition and execution of architectural improvements across all our software development groups, this is the place for you.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.

You will be a part of a diverse group of over a dozen engineers (and growing!). The systems you will be designing and developing will have a direct impact on improving the customer experience across all Amazon.com websites around the globe.

That means you have experience in JavaScript language features, frameworks, and libraries and the associated UI technologies mentioned earlier. (It would be great if you have micro frontend experience too).

As a Senior Software Development Engineer, you will be responsible for creating clever solutions to help us get better at cutting through the noise of high-volume metric data, identifying problems, interpreting the root cause, creating mechanisms for smaller blast radius of events, and reducing both the frequency and duration of interruptions to the shopping experience. You will work closely with Machine Learning Scientists to analyze past events and develop deep learning algorithms to prevent future recurrence. Our systems use AWS technologies such as SageMaker, Redshift, DynamoDB, Kinesis and S3 using primarily GoLang, Python and Java.
