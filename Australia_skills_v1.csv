At Deputy we’re on a mission to change the way the world works. Since 2008 over 200 million shifts have been rostered on Deputy, in over 90 countries, and across 245 different industries.

The Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported over 80 million hourly workers comprising over 60% of the US workforce in 2017. Global estimates are that hourly workers are 80 – 90% of the workforce. Yet while hourly workers comprise such large majorities of the global workforce, there is a stark lack of software tools available today that directly address their needs

We’re making it easier for businesses and teams to roster staff, manage leave, complete payroll and take the admin out of work so that our customers can focus on doing what they love. We hire amazing people to do what they’re best at, and work with some incredible businesses all around the world.

Deputy believes in equal opportunity and that inclusiveness and diversity promotes innovation. Our global team members are from a variety of cultures. And we welcome different perspective and skills.

Welcome!

We're so happy you found us. Since you've come this far, it's safe to say you're curious about our story and what career opportunities exist, so we'd love to start by introducing ourselves.

Then & Now

Our story ( https://envato.com/blog/the-story-of-envato/ ) starts in 2006 with three founders in a Sydney garage (no, we're not kidding). Born from a desire to earn a living doing what they loved, with the flexibility ( https://envato.com/blog/flexibility-at-the-heart-of-life-at-envato/ ) to do it from anywhere, Envato set out to create an online community for buying and selling creative digital assets. Nearly 13 years later, we're profitable and still totally bootstrapped. This allows us to stay experimental and totally focused on the best interests of our authors & customers around the world.

We've built marketplaces where anyone can buy and sell the creative assets they need to complete their projects faster. Our community can now buy millions of different kinds of assets on Envato Market ( https://themeforest.net/ ), or subscribe to the #1 unlimited subscription service for creatives, Envato Elements ( https://elements.envato.com/ ). Every day, these products continue to help everyone from freelancers to small business owners and agencies get their creative projects done.

While we are known and loved within the digital professional community globally, where our authors have earned over $750 million ( http://press.envato.com/172514-envato-closes-in-on-1-billion-usd-in-community-earnings ), we also want to be a place where anyone can Make with Envato.

Overview

Supporting a consulting company across a client project for an Electricity provider.


At the moment there’s a disconnect between the electrical engineering team coming up with a solution and implementing that through the data science/coding team.


The data science people are running some machine learning projects but they lack the engineering knowledge to establish best practices instead of throwing large amounts of data into a program to try get an answer.


Whats the Job?


They need someone to be able to sit in the room with the engineers and understand what they’re discussing, then go off and work with the coders to find the right data sources and finish it off in a visualisation.


You will be working across a range of projects taking huge volumes of data from electricity meters, and other transponders to achieve engineering efficiencies.


What are we after in our ideal candidate ?


You would need to have an electrical background or understanding of electricity, ideally worked in the energy industry. Also needs to be across coding and machine learning.


You will need a thorough understanding of how electrical power is generated and transmitted across a network, together with a Data Science Capacity


We would like someone who doesn’t need a high level of supervision, but can take a problem, go do some research and come up with a solution.


Currently having to micromanage a lot of coders as most of them aren’t seasoned data scientists.


You will need good communication skills


Level


Doesn’t have to be someone especially senior in experience if they have the right skillset.

As a team lead you’ll naturally be keeping an eye on the team members and making sure that they are both challenged and supported so that they continue to thrive. Part of this will naturally include coaching and mentoring as well as keeping them focused on the job.

What you’ll do
Develop robust, high-quality software that meets the expectations of your product development team’s standards and procedures and meets modern best practices for highly scalable, reliable, maintainable software.
Coach and mentor each of your people to help them become the best versions of themselves they can be, including performance feedback and career development.
Be accountable for the technical decision making of the team.
Be comfortable building a microservice architecture that delivers highly scalable, reliable, and maintainable APIs.
Spend a proportion of time on people-focused tasks, including recruitment, leave approvals.
Help the team to work across team boundaries to ensure the delivery of changes that integrate well with the wider set of Xero products and technologies

Passionate about helping people reach their full potential with the ability to lead, mentor and develop
Strong Experience with cloud technologies and architectures including serverless
People leadership experience either as a direct line manager or a technical leadership position
Experience with .NET for backend development, especially the creation of API services
Experienced in devops culture including CI/CD processes, and software development at all levels of the tech stack, with capability from front end, microservices, databases and platforms

146,146,9d1f37c280c17198,100000,PhD Scholarship Top-up – Defence Science and Technology Group,The University of Queensland,St Lucia QLD,"[St Lucia QLDFull-time, ContractCentre for Hypersonics
UQ’s Centre for Hypersonics has four PhD scholarship top-ups available for collaborative projects with the Defence Science and Technology Group (DST Group). The projects, detailed below, will be co-supervised by a DST scientist. The student will be based at UQ St Lucia, but will conduct their experiments at X3's new location with DST Group at Eaglefarm with DST technical support.

Projects 1 & 2: Radiation signatures
The radiation trails left behind in the shock layers and wakes of hypersonic flight vehicles are important foot prints which enable identification of the altitude, location, and direction of the vehicle, and may also be used to indicate something about their design and purpose. They may be created from radiating high temperature shock layers, and can be significantly enhanced by hot ablative products from TPS insulation and by combustion products from air breathing and rocket propelled systems.

Prediction techniques are not currently well advanced, and more experimental data and fundamental studies are needed to be able to confidently categorise and predict the signatures of specific vehicle configurations over their operational envelopes. The requirements for experimental studies include advanced hypersonic test facilities, the ability to create the associated sources of ablative and combustion products, and the instrumentation required to track the propagation and spectral intensity of radiating products in a hypersonic flowfield. The laboratories of UQ and DST are well suited to perform such a study, and have extensive expertise in the related diagnostics and instrumentation.

Project 1: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on ablation-driven radiating wakes.

Project 2: The purpose of this proposed project is to perform a series of experimental investigations into these effects, focussing on wake signatures produced by propulsion systems.

Interested in these projects? Read more about Professor Richard Morgan, and Associate Professor Tim McIntyre. To discuss these projects, please email Associate Professor McIntyre.

Project 3: High altitude Earth re-entry testing in a large scale expansion tube
A manned mission to Mars will see the fastest ever spacecraft return to Earth, up to 13 km/s. The engineering challenges of Earth re-entry at these speeds are still to be overcome, and suitable wind tunnel testing capabilities will be essential to fully understand the flow physics and to test new technologies at these speeds. One promising technology is magnetohydrodynamic aerobraking, which can potentially use the interaction between a magnetic field and the hot plasma enveloping the spacecraft to dissipate the spacecraft's immense kinetic energy when it first reaches the atmosphere, when speeds are a maximum but density is low enough to make heating manageable.

Australia is currently a world leader in aerodynamic ground testing of planetary entry flows, and its X2 and X3 facilities are routinely used to study Earth re-entry flows up to 11 km/s. However, neither facility can currently generate the low density part of superorbital flows associated with ambitious future missions such as deep space return from Mars or the Gas Giants. This project involves extending the test capability for X3 - the world's largest free-piston driven expansion tube - to make this testing possible.

The PhD will address several technical challenges which currently prevent this performance. X3's free-piston driver is currently limited by its piston mass; its current lightest piston, which has been structurally optimised for CNC machining from aluminium, weighs 100kg, but for these test flows the piston needs to be much lighter. This can only be achieved through structural optimisation using new manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing.

Control of piston dynamics becomes increasingly difficult as mass is reduced and acceleration increases. This PhD will develop an accelerometer diagnostics package to measure piston trajectory and thereby guide the development of new driver operating conditions. A recent prototype device has demonstrated proof-of-concept up to 2000g peak acceleration for this application; this PhD must extend this performance to 20,000g, and will examine how additional diagnostics can be integrated into the device.

Model size must be maximised, which is achieved with a nozzle expansion to the test section. However, X3's existing nozzles have not been developed for such high speeds and low densities, and a new nozzle will also be necessary to achieve the new testing capability. This capability will be verified through numerical analysis and finally experimental testing. The outcome of this project will be the world's highest performance superorbital aerodynamic test capability for deep space return re-entry.

Interested? Read more about Dr David Gildfind, or email him about this project.

Project 4: Development of high performance shock tube conditions
The performance of high speed shock tunnels is limited by the constraints of speed, pressure, length scale, and the required test flow duration. Related to this is the scope and scale of experiments which can be performed in the facilities. Recent modifications to the X3 facility at UQ have led to new test conditions in the reflected shock tunnel mode which enable steady flow durations of the order of 10 ms to be reached with an 800 mm nozzle exit. This new operating mode, known as X3R, is currently limited to total pressures of the order of 10 MPa at Mach 7 with a 560 kg piston. This envelope can potentially be stretched to total pressures of 40 MPa and enthalpies up to the order of 6 km/s, at the expense of test time, by using lighter pistons. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the full potential operating envelope of the facility, and establish a range of calibrated operating conditions which will greatly extend our capability to do useful hypersonics research. Honours Graduates from Engineering, the Physical Sciences and Applied Mathematics all have potentially suitable backgrounds for this project. There will be a strong experimental component to the work, and students will need to have good analytical and numerical skills.

In assessing merit, the panel will take into
consideration “performance or achievement
relative to opportunity”. We recognise that

circumstances, and career histories that
challenge traditional ideas of an academic

prioritising the quality of achievement rather
than the quantity, as considerations of part-

significant periods of leave are taken into
account when assessing performance or
achievement.

conducting a process which is fair and free
from bias, including unconscious bias.

About us
Specialised computer vision algorithms underpin Seeing Machines core camera-based driver monitoring technology. Algorithms allow us to precisely track eye gaze, head position and pupil size, while our state-of the-art AI technology analyses the data to quickly and accurately detect driver drowsiness, distraction and microsleep levels.
The why of our technology


According to the World Health Organisation, over 1.3 million people die in road accidents, globally.
The American Automobile Association says that 1 in every 10 auto accidents in the US is fatigue related and that 25% of US car accidents are caused by distraction.
European Commission recommends that camera-based driver monitoring technology be mandated to enhance safety in cars, vans, trucks and buses from 2022.
Air traffic is set to double over 15 years and the world's aviation fleet is set to double in 20 years. This creates a huge demand for more pilots and air traffic management which increases pressure on training and safety frameworks for the aviation industry, globally.
Seeing Machines' Guardian technology for commercial fleets has been scientifically proven to reduce fatigue related driver events by more than 90%.

For over 15 years Quantium have combined the best of human and artificial intelligence to power possibilities for individuals, organisations and society. Our solutions make sense of what has happened and what will, could or should be done to re-shape industries and societies around the needs of the people they serve.

Times and technology have changed, but this remains our goal. Instead of wrangling single, SQL-based databases, our MapR Hadoop platform runs across 300 nodes with multiple clusters using the latest big data technology.

We’re looking for that rarity to lead our future technology and approach. You’ll be testing out any data orientated tech you want – you think we can take that 4 hour processing time down to 10 mins using Kafka? Give it a go! Prove it. Think that Scala has had its’ day and we need to move to something more useable? Show us a model.

Whatever you can prove, we’ll go for, just bear in mind, you’re the subject matter expert so you’re going to have to field the questions and teach people how to use it.

FAQ:

So I have a Sandbox to play in?

Kinda… you’ll be given a huge amount of free rein to try a range of technologies and apply them to our problem sets. You will also have to prove to professional sceptics that this is the right path, and then support your initiatives with hard data.

How does this team work?

You’ll be joining the Data and Platforms Team as their Lead Analyst. The team is responsible for investigating, testing and implementing the technology solutions that power our insight. There are 8 engineers and 6 analysts in this team. You’ll have a team of 4 Analysts under you and work closely with the engineering team to implement your ideas.
What are you looking for in the ideal candidate?

You’ll be a career Analyst or Data Scientist. Data scale is something you’re very used to; machine learning, decision trees, neural networks (insert more buzzwords) will all be areas you’re familiar with, along with the code to use them. You’ll be at a time in your career where you’re a bit bored of working on client problems, to client timelines and are fascinated by technology. You’ll love tinkering, experimenting with new tech, and most importantly, be used to following through on your recommendations.
Do you have a bullet point checklist for me to check off my suitability?

We know people are not bullet points but sure thing!

You have:

5+ years Analytics experience including carrying out data analytics or data science work
Previous experience working with large complex datasets and associated Big Data technologies e.g. Scala, Spark, Hadoop, Zeppelin or similar
Demonstrable ability to work with and influence senior stakeholders

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.

We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.

And we're just getting started

The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.

The Role

We are looking for a Marketing Analyst to join our team based in our Melbourne Head Office. The primary role of the Marketing Analyst will be to support the marketing team with various data requests. This role is responsible for the creation and design of reports and reporting tools as well as the provision of data analysis to deliver insights to key decision makers to assist in all marketing planning and analysis.

The role will involve:

Providing analytical support across the broader marketing team, by assisting in setting up effective post-analysis and reporting
Analysing the impact of marketing activity on business performance
Support marketing in driving campaign effectiveness through ongoing optimisation of data selection and KPI development
Creating and managing visualisation analysis using Looker, excel and other programs
Collaborating with other data scientists and marketing colleagues to drive and continually improve reporting solutions
Converting gathered data into easily comprehensible information and dispersing insights and recommendations across the team and management
Understanding and optimising return on marketing investment
Continually improving all data processes within the marketing team.
Creation, roll out & ownership of processes, tools and reporting dashboards to improve internal efficiency
Support marketing team with Ad hoc analysis, insights and reporting requests

Requirements:
The ideal candidate is highly analytical with a strong set of organizational and communication skills. You'll be able to think strategically, validate your assumptions with data, and then execute quickly on your plans.

You should also be:

Driven, hard-working and agile. We move fast at Deliveroo and you'll be comfortable with the same
Extremely analytical and have a passion for detail, marketing and data crunching
Resourceful, creative, and with a keen eye for leveraging data insights to help our marketing team make more insightful business decisions. You're detail-oriented and able to maintain a high level of accuracy across all aspects of your work.
Able to create reports and dashboards such as Looker, Power Bi or Tableau to be used by marketing and business stakeholders
Comfortable working with individuals at all levels. You must be a team player and able to galvanise support from colleagues across departments and cities.
An expert in Excel. Experience using SQL, Looker and Google Suite would be beneficial

Life at Deliveroo

We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up's around.]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Be part of our digital transformation

Innovate leading edge solutions

Be right in the heart of Melbourne CBD

At Australia Post, innovation is at the heart of our transformation, and we are committed to ensuring our teams of digital specialists are challenged, supported and recognised. Technology is transforming our world and because our customers are at the heart of everything we do, we're changing too. So, we provide an environment that ensures we deliver the best: leading edge technologies; a creative, agile approach; a unique breadth of projects and an unexpectedly dynamic, small team culture that feels more like a start-up than a 208-year old icon.

What's the job involve?

TrustCheck is a new corporate start up with a ground-breaking approach to fraud prevention that is being jointly developed by NAB and Australia Post. We’re exploring new ways of applying data science to help merchants reduce losses, improve customer experiences and grow their business online with confidence.

The TrustCheck Fraud Analytics Lead is a hands-on and client facing leadership role reporting directly to the TrustCheck Business Owner. The role will lead the TrustCheck data science team in the development, delivery and ongoing management of machine learning models. The role will work with clients to design data experiments, then conduct and manage real-time machine learning models that generate live insights. A key focus of the role is leveraging data to predict identity fraud.

This is a fantastic opportunity for a mid-senior level data scientist or fraud analyst who is looking to take the next step in their career. It’s the chance to develop and own technologies that are at the heart of an independent venture that uses the might of corporate Australia to better protect our community from fraud.

Key accountabilities will include:
Data Science

use advanced analytics and machine learning to generate actionable fraud insights for our business customers

work with customer and our insight partners data teams to understand and source data for experiments, and design experiments to test the efficacy of our product for particular use cases

designing data science features that maximise the predictive capability of data available to TrustCheck

continually improve and evolve the data science capability

Management of real time data science models

manage the full life-cycle of real-time data science models: model development, promotion to production, monitoring and retraining

retrain models to respond to new fraud vectors or in response to model drift

Leadership

lead the data science team, prioritising work and scheduling to meet deadlines and deliverables

develop the data science strategy and roadmap

mentor and develop data science team members

communicate results to senior stakeholders and clients in a commercial meaningful way

What it's like to work here:
For you, it means you’ll do great work, learn from the best and develop a career within a robust and well invested but empowering and creative environment. We all work hard – we’re working on major challenges, after all – but we also recognise that you have a life outside of the office, so we provide flexible conditions that enable you to grow whilst enjoying genuine work life balance.

What we're looking for:
A degree, or significant professional experience, in qualitative or numerate discipline (statistics, mathematics, computer science etc)

Demonstrable experience with python, tableau, SQL and database technologies

Experience collecting, analysing and modelling data related to fraud, information security or credit decisioning

Hands on experience building end to end production grade machine learning pipelines in cloud environment (AWS preferred)

Experience managing real-time machine learning models

Ability to work at the detailed level while being mindful of the big picture

Proven experience leading and mentoring teams

Excellent communication and collaboration skills in cross functional teams (both technical and non-technical) and demonstrated experience working with senior commercial stakeholders (clients, non-technical stakeholders, etc) to understand their needs, design experiments or solutions to their challenges and articulating results and strategies back to them in a meaningful way.

Fraud analytics and modelling experience highly desirable

7 plus years relevant industry experience

Technical skills are important, however they are not everything. We see our culture just as important and therefore the candidate will have:

Excellent communication skills

Ability to work autonomously

Desire to try new things

Be friendly and approachable!

This role is a foundation role in our team. You'll have the chance to help build the planning offering from the ground up. Not only is it a full service model, but it's also centralised within strategic planning in the experience team. Why?

We're fortunate to have some excellent data scientists working with us helping to build the latest and greatest in models.

Working with media partners and other members of the team to help develop relationships.
Helping to educate the wider agency and other departments.

Desired Skills and Experience


A strong understanding of the industry particularly in the Melbourne market. Ideally 3+ years of experience.
A proven history of strong strategic outputs.
The ability to create a narrative around a strategy to help to bring it to life.
Ideally fully integrated, however we will consider candidates with a strong skill set predominately in digital.
An understanding of data, how it can be used and its importance will be preferred.
Equally any understanding of DMP or the Adobe Marketing Cloud will also be preferred.
The ability to lead relationships with media partners for the agency.
Experience across industry standard tools. Plus the ability to lead the search for new and innovative solutions.
The ability to work in a team and with other departments in the agency to solve client's business problems.
The desire to look forward, review interesting trends both inside and outside the industry and contribute to the vision of the agency
An ambition to change the way things are done

Is not intimidated by the idea of working in new ways and with new technology
Loves to work in an agile way

Who is CHE Proximity
More than ever before the medium, the messaging and sequencing are inseperable from each other.
‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls;, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

Who is CHE Proximity
More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other.
‘Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls;, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

295,295,a589b119d47d24e0,80000,Lead DevOps Engineer,Quantium,Sydney NSW,"[Sydney NSWSince 2002, our data teams have wrung every bit of information they can from our clients’ data in order to give them the insight they need to make a real difference to their business.

Times and technology have changed, but this remains our goal. Instead of wrangling single, SQL-based databases and ASP.net web applications, our MapR Hadoop platform runs across 200 nodes with multiple clusters and .net APIs and react.js/Angular 1&2 web products plugging in. Our Hybrid on-prem/cloud platform is also coming along nicely.

Our industry-leading partners’ real-world data sets and SAAS product requirements are growing along with their complexity so we need to adapt our ways of working to allow for better CI/CD pipelines, performance, availability and all the rest of the “Devops” buzzwords. We need someone to lead the charge. We’re hoping that’s you.

Our Platform Team have done a wonderful job in providing as much support to our product focused engineering teams, but with some serious infrastructure initiatives underway, they need to focus on that area, while allowing for a team to allow us to deploy at scale.

This role is pivotal for Quantium to deploy and grow its machine learning product capability both in the local market and overseas by enabling effortless operation of the pipelines in hybrid environments.

It’s at this point I’d normally give you an overview of the tech involved. But let’s face it, you know that way better than us. That’s why we’re hiring this role.

Role Details/FAQ:

What is it the I’ll be working on?

We have an initial product environment for you to use as your test bed, to get to know the business and the ways we have been working up to now. You will be embedding with our engineers, data scientists and wider product team to bring a new definition of what an engineering environment looks like from a release perspective.

Q.Refinery is the Quantium flagship offering for the banking vertical, ingesting millions of bank transactions, curating and enriching them using advanced analytical techniques. Our engineering team develops data pipelines leveraging Spark and the BidData ecosystem in order to deliver our analytics capability to our clients, either on premises or in the cloud.

Once you’ve shown what you can do here, you will be given the keys to the kingdom, bringing your knowledge and capability to the wider product engineering environment, building a team and a whole new capability.

Who can I expect to work with?

We work in multi-discipline teams so you’ll be working alongside Data Scientists, Analysts, Testers and platform engineers, depending on the project. For this role, however, you can be expecting to work far wider, influencing thought and direction.

What are we looking for in the ideal candidate?

Firstly, you can be anybody, from any walk of life. Before we get to your skills we want you to know that we actively try to foster an environment where all our employees feel safe, welcomed and celebrated. We look for the same in all people we hire

Do you have a strong bias towards action? Are you good at finding patterns in messy datasets, or making decisions with incomplete information? Using your product acumen and technical creativity, you will build tools to automate reporting and generate insights that will allow our product leaders to quickly and accurately see how our product is performing. We’re growing quickly, so you'll need to define, implement, and scale the systems and processes for delivering data to your colleagues across the Product org.

Product Analytics at Atlassian is multidisciplinary. The perfect teammate is someone who has the skills to surface insights quickly, and communicate those insights in a way that persuades action from PMs, designers, and engineers alike. You'll use SQL, R, and/or Python often, as your principal output will be better understanding user behaviour. However, you won't be at your desk all day. Part of your job is to improve the data literacy of your product team, teaching people when, where, and how to harness the data available. We'll measure the actions and decisions that result from the information you provide and ensure you have the right tools, support, and forums to succeed in enacting data-informed change.

You’ll be working with our Teamwork Platform team in our Sydney headquarters. You will partner closely with a team of Product Managers, Designers, Developers, and Data Scientists in building the core components of Atlassian’s product suite. Teamwork Platform’s products include:
Editor, a central feature of Confluence used across Atlassian products
Notifications Platform, which provides Atlassian’s customers with meaningful notifications that fuel collaboration
Essentials, which enable consistent collaboration and allow our customers to discover and move between products.

Atlassian is experiencing rapid growth, and Teamwork Platform creates the common thread across Atlassian products, so there are plentiful chances to create meaningful impact. We’re very outcome-focused, and we timebox our investigations to have a clear start and finish.
On the first day, we'll expect you to have:
3-5 years of experience in Analytics or Data Science
Knowledge of the product development lifecycle and common Product org structures
Experience in designing and analyzing experiments that drive key product decisions
Familiarity with event-based analytics, and a curiosity to learn more
Knowledge of data instrumentation and logging
Expertise in SQL and proficiency in another data programming language (Python, R, etc.)
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Mode)
Ability to work comfortably with a command line interface
It's great, but not required, if you have:
Experience working in a global environment with remote teams
An advanced degree in a quantitative discipline, such as statistics, mathematics, economics, or computer science

We're also always looking for excellent written and verbal communication skills, a great eye for detail, and a sense of humor!
