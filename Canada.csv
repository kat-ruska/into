About BenchSci
We empower the world's scientists to run more successful experiments to accelerate drug discovery.

With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSci’s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.

Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:

Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.
Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better. This applies to our product and business, but also to ourselves.
Speed: We recognize that without a sense of urgency, our team, our product and our mission lose their value.
Tenacity: What we’re trying to do isn’t easy, but we hire the best people, and give them the autonomy, tools, and resources to succeed. The hard work is up to them.
Transparency: We believe that sharing diverse ideas and information creates strong teams. Our success stems from research, collaboration, feedback, and trust.

About BenchSci
We empower the world's scientists to run more successful experiments to accelerate drug discovery.

With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSci’s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.

Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:

Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.

BenchSci’s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.

Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:

Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.
Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better. This applies to our product and business, but also to ourselves.
Speed: We recognize that without a sense of urgency, our team, our product and our mission lose their value.
Tenacity: What we’re trying to do isn’t easy, but we hire the best people, and give them the autonomy, tools, and resources to succeed. The hard work is up to them.
Transparency: We believe that sharing diverse ideas and information creates strong teams. Our success stems from research, collaboration, feedback, and trust.

BenchSci is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment. All four of our cofounders are immigrants to Canada, as are many of our employees. We welcome your fresh perspectives and ideas.]"

82,ac0ed6d0d0c35faf,100000,Senior Data Science Manager - Insights,Shopify,"Ottawa, ON","[Ottawa, ONAt Shopify, we recognize that after our people, our most important asset is our data. With over 10+ years of aggregate ecommerce data, we are driven by the potential insights that our data can provide. Our 1,000,000+ merchants process over $72 billion in gross merchant volume through our platform, and depend on us to deliver insights that enable them to grow their business. We’re looking for a Senior Manager to lead Data Science for our merchant-facing Insights product - part of Shopify Core. Core is what all of our merchants login to - it’s the interface of their business(es). It’s also where merchants spend most of their time. Merchants go there to set up their store(s), manage their products, pricing, collections, inventory, orders, and fulfillment, and make decisions based on reports, insights, and recommendations.

Delivering meaningful insights and predictive recommendations that help guide a business owner around product, marketing, logistics, finance and customers decisions is a huge opportunity. Your team’s mandate involves developing and scaling these insights across 800,000+ businesses, countless product types, geographies, and sizes of merchants. Most of those 800k+ businesses are too small to staff a team focused on understanding their data, but you can help all of them to leverage advanced analytics and machine learning to make better decisions and succeed in competitive markets.

You would also be responsible for the machine learning and data backend powering Shopify Home: the news feed and home page of Shopify where merchants see predictive recommendations for all aspects of their business.

This is a full-stack role spanning data science, data engineering and product analytics. The aim is to identify, build and understand the impact of merchant-facing data products and insights that will have a clear and well-understood impact on the success of their businesses.

Shopify Core team members you’ll work closely with:
Farhana Alarakhiya, VP Product, Insights and Analytics
Lynsey Thornton, GM of Core

Shopify Core teams are based in the Ottawa and Montreal offices. This role would be based in Ottawa.
Your Key Attributes:
Team development - Extensive experience growing well-rounded leaders and scaling teams while instilling process to drive excellence and strong execution. You’ll be leading an 11 person team, including 3 managers, overseeing both data scientists and data engineers.
Well-balanced skills - People have trouble pinning you down. Both business and technical teams claim you as their own. You can jump into the code to the level that your team members admire and respect, but are also comfortable discussing ideas with senior executives and collaborating/influencing across disciplines and teams.
Data Experience at scale - You’ve worked at multiple tech companies where analytics on top of massive data sets drives better product/business decisions and results in impactful data products. You have experience implementing and assessing productionized machine learning models. You have extensive ETL experience and know how to make complex datasets more reliable and useful.
Passionate about Commerce - You’ve experienced and thrived in similar business models and have a passion for solving the types of problems that our merchants face in the e-commerce and retail spaces.
Full-stack skills you’ll need to have:
4+ years managing high performance data science teams
8+ years delivering business impact through analysis and data products
Extensive experience with SQL and Python (or similar languages)
Extensive experience with data pipelines and ETL design
Experience with statistical methods like regressions, GLMs, experiment design and shipping productionized machine learning systems at scale
Experience with Tableau, Mode, or similar data visualization tools

About BenchSci
We empower the world's scientists to run more successful experiments to accelerate drug discovery.

With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSci’s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.

Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:

Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.
Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better. This applies to our product and business, but also to ourselves.
Speed: We recognize that without a sense of urgency, our team, our product and our mission lose their value.
Tenacity: What we’re trying to do isn’t easy, but we hire the best people, and give them the autonomy, tools, and resources to succeed. The hard work is up to them.
Transparency: We believe that sharing diverse ideas and information creates strong teams. Our success stems from research, collaboration, feedback, and trust.

BenchSci is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment. All four of our cofounders are immigrants to Canada, as are many of our employees. We welcome your fresh perspectives and ideas.]"

Tableau is as much a philosophy as an amazing suite of tools. We enable people to transform data into something visual and understandable, enabling people to make important decisions based on those insights. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you.
With large deployments of Tableau, containing millions of visualizations, we need to provide people with tools to find the data that is important to them. No matter how good our platform is at showing meaningful and beautiful visualizations, they can’t have an impact if they cannot be found. We are building a brand new team to focus exclusively on content discoverability through search. This team will help more people see and understand their data by making it very easy to find the data and visualizations they’re looking for.
Some of the things you’ll be doing include …
This role will have the opportunity to spearhead this new initiative, driving towards a unified search experience in the Tableau ecosystem. You would be working closely with our data scientists to use machine learning and advanced search algorithms to create meaningful search results in our products. In order to be successful, this role requires you to be comfortable with ambiguity, rapid prototyping, digging through legacy code, modern architectural design patterns, mixed (SaaS/On Prem) deployments, scaling and security concerns, and ideally, have worked with search and relevancy before. You are not expected to be a research engineer (we have those), but rather a very strong enterprise/SaaS Java developer who can work with large scale systems.
Who you are…
Relentlessly High Standards . Your personal software practices ensure you deliver high quality even under schedule pressure. You believe in automation and writing tests for your own code as a way of maintaining high quality in your products. “Good enough” is never good enough!
Coding Rockstar . You understand what it takes to write highly scalable enterprise and consumer software that is used by millions of people. You love writing code that ""just works"" - that is reliable, scalable, and secure. You think far enough ahead to avoid tech debt, but know how to avoid over-engineering. You are agile and can prototype, learn, adapt, and pivot as needed.
Team Player. You enjoy collaborating with, learning from, and teaching others (including across disciplines) so we all become better. You’ve been a technical leader and really enjoy mentoring and leading projects and technical excellence within the team. You are comfortable debating challenging problems, know when to disagree and commit, and don’t let ego get in the way of getting the work done.
Experienced. You are a Java expert and have years (10+) of experience with large scale Java systems, having worked with a variety of common frameworks and libraries popular in Java shops (e.g. Spring and Hibernate). You’ve worked with a variety of database technologies with very large datasets and understand how to optimize for maximum performance and scale. You understand the various layers of the software stack, know where to utilize code, when to use caching, when to leverage the database or event bus to create a highly performant system. You understand microservice design patterns very well and how to create loosely coupled SaaS systems. You’ve also worked with on premise deployed projects.
Motivated. You do good work, and lots of it, and not because your boss is watching…the drive to deliver is just a part of you. You aren’t a clock watcher, but are focused on getting your best work done.
You are a Recruiter! Tableau hires company builders and, in this role, you will be asked to be on the constant lookout for the best talent to bring onboard to help us continue to build one of the best companies in the world!

Tableau is as much a philosophy as an amazing suite of tools. We enable people to transform data into something visual and understandable, enabling people to make important decisions based on those insights. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you.
With large deployments of Tableau, containing millions of visualizations, we need to provide people with tools to find the data that is important to them. No matter how good our platform is at showing meaningful and beautiful visualizations, they can’t have an impact if they cannot be found. We are building a brand new team to focus exclusively on content discoverability through search. This team will help more people see and understand their data by making it very easy to find the data and visualizations they’re looking for.
Some of the things you’ll be doing include …
This role will have the opportunity to spearhead this new initiative, driving towards a unified search experience in the Tableau ecosystem. You would be working closely with the research scientists on other teams to use machine learning and advanced search algorithms to create highly relevant search results in our products. In order to be successful, this role requires you to be comfortable with ambiguity, rapid prototyping, and working with senior enterprise developers to create production worthy code.
Who you are…
Relentlessly High Standards . Your personal software practices ensure you deliver high quality even under schedule pressure. You believe in automation and writing tests for your own code as a way of maintaining high quality in your products. “Good enough” is never good enough!
Search Relevancy Enthusiast . You understand the search problem deeply and all the related challenges. You know how to use specific algorithms, measure search relevance, and collect data to create highly relevant search results. You know where ML (machine learning) fits into this picture, where search indexes play a role, and how to use ranking services to increase search relevancy.
Coder. While your passion is research, you’re also a rock solid coder, who knows how to get scalable, quality, production worthy code out the door. You’ve made the connection between theoretical code and real-world code and know how to translate your ideas into shippable products. You’ve worked in Python (preferably also with Java) and aren’t afraid of the terminal.
Team Player. You enjoy collaborating with, learning from, and teaching others (including across disciplines) so we all become better. You’ve experienced working with senior enterprise developers to turn your research ideas into highly scalable enterprise solutions.
Experienced. You have a very deep understanding of search related algorithms. You understand state of the art information retrieval techniques and have expertise on how to use natural language to yield highly relevant results. You have worked with machine learning in a production environment and know when and where to use it to help solve real world business problems.
Motivated. You do good work, and lots of it, and not because your boss is watching…the drive to deliver is just a part of you. You aren’t a clock watcher, but are focused on getting your best work done.
You are a Recruiter! Tableau hires company builders and, in this role, you will be asked to be on the constant lookout for the best talent to bring onboard to help us continue to build one of the best companies in the world!

About BenchSci
We empower the world's scientists to run more successful experiments to accelerate drug discovery.

With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSci’s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.

Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:

Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.
Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better. This applies to our product and business, but also to ourselves.
Speed: We recognize that without a sense of urgency, our team, our product and our mission lose their value.
Tenacity: What we’re trying to do isn’t easy, but we hire the best people, and give them the autonomy, tools, and resources to succeed. The hard work is up to them.
Transparency: We believe that sharing diverse ideas and information creates strong teams. Our success stems from research, collaboration, feedback, and trust.

BenchSci is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment. All four of our cofounders are immigrants to Canada, as are many of our employees. We welcome your fresh perspectives and ideas.]"

About BenchSci
We empower the world's scientists to run more successful experiments to accelerate drug discovery.

With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSci’s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.

Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:

Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.

Sounds good? Keep reading...

Responsibilities:What your day will look like:
Genetec’s Data Science group is looking for a new Research scientist to join its team which will help build new analytical anomaly detection, machine learning, and signal processing solutions to expand out current product offerings. The data science team works on all manner of problems except those of computer vision. The team crosses all internal product boundaries of Genetec and and focuses on solutions relating to anomaly detection and meta-data leraning. The candidate will work in a fast-paced environment developing applications and tools which utilize state-of-the-art statistical and ML technologies and algorithms. Key responsibilities include:

Exploring datasets, training models, and performing model selection
Developing small user interface/visualization tools to demonstrate functionality and verify performance
Identifying and proposing solutions to problems which can assist our product lines as well as identifying boundaries where the information from product offerings can be merged to gather more comprehensive understandings of the world.

The candidate will work in the R&D Data Science team which is one of Genetec’s Platform teams. The data science team is tasked with tackling the many machine learning, signal processing, and anomaly detection problems which arise internally in our various product lines excluding the domain of computer vision (Genetec has 2 other teams which do exclusively computer vision). We work with the multiple groups within Genetec to determine their various domain-specific problems, analyze if the problems are solvable, and provide a prototype solution if possible. Since this is a heavily research-based team, the team does not follow the typical release cycle of the rest of Genetec until a project’s feasibility is assured.

Once a prototype is created, we then establish a release to the team (or teams) which will be benefiting from the tool/algorithm created as well as demonstrating how it works and providing at least preliminary support after deployment. This team does not work on any single product line within Genetec but crosses almost all internal team boundaries to help solve the various and complex mathematical problems which arise within Genetec’s scope of work.

All current members are researchers who have performed graduate-level work in statistics; supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised machine learning; statistical signal processing; and anomaly detection.

Still interested? Don't stop here!

About BenchSci
We empower the world's scientists to run more successful experiments to accelerate drug discovery.

With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSci’s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.

Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:

Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.
Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better. This applies to our product and business, but also to ourselves.
Speed: We recognize that without a sense of urgency, our team, our product and our mission lose their value.
Tenacity: What we’re trying to do isn’t easy, but we hire the best people, and give them the autonomy, tools, and resources to succeed. The hard work is up to them.
Transparency: We believe that sharing diverse ideas and information creates strong teams. Our success stems from research, collaboration, feedback, and trust.

BenchSci is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment. All four of our cofounders are immigrants to Canada, as are many of our employees. We welcome your fresh perspectives and ideas.]"

We also want to make it easy to do the right thing: ML systems that run in production should be production-quality. We want to create company-wide standards for what that means and give people the tools to implement them (so that nobody has an excuse not to).

We don’t just focus on data scientists. ML really is not rocket science, and for the right problems even very simple approaches can yield remarkable results.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

629,ca7c9f38df9ab557,60000,Front End Developer (Senior),Skywatch,"Waterloo, ON","[Waterloo, ONOUR TEAM

Let’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with a leader who has your back, while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.

Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data and unicorn startup veterans who come from ten different countries. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for startups, an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are Techstars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started.


OUR CULTURE

Culture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. Both as a company and in our products we value simplicity, dependability, and empathy.

In engineering, we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First), flexibility over rigorous top down process (Freedom & Autonomy), and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture).

Our mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk, we walk the walk.


OUR PRODUCT

Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.

While the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially, we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogues is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved, it is difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system. And we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.

Using our team's experience in building NASA-award winning software, we are building the SkyWatch EarthCacheTM platform, a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and app developers to monitor the progress of crops, predict the markets, track ships and airplanes, measure global warming, or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world.

Sound exciting? You’re right — it is.


ABOUT YOU

You have the ability to solve problems, not just complete tasks. You are an artist and a craftsperson. You empathize with those who use what you’ve built. You want to solve their problems.

You have strong technical chops, but can also describe technical things to non-technical people. You can tell a ten-year-old how an API works and not have them glaze over with boredom. Or a CEO. Or your significant other. OK, maybe not your significant other.

You have a diverse background. Volunteer as a Big Sister? Speak multiple languages? Love to paint? Play a sport? We love diversity and value how much it adds to our team.

You have a thirst for learning. We learn something every day. We find it intoxicating. If you’d rather master one thing and do that every day, this probably isn’t the role for you.

You have thoughtful opinions that you feel comfortable sharing. We have a culture that makes sharing opinions safe. If everyone in a meeting always thinks the same way, we have too many people in that meeting.

You have the ability to give more than you take. We have an incredible team. We want you to make it even incredibler.

YOUR TECHNICAL ARSENAL

You are an Angular aficionado and leverage Typescript.

You believe in automated testing and take pride as well as ownership of the code you write.

You’ve built software of some kind to solve a problem in your life outside of work.

You can identify awesome and horrible API designs and articulate the difference.

You could write code in an hour or less that parses www.skywatch.com and returns a list of our available data sources.

You have tried the free tier on AWS, and have created a serverless application.

You’ve used git at the command line and have felt the pain of merge conflicts.

You’ve secured an application and can articulate the value of differing security levels.

 YOUR TYPICAL DAY

9:00 am — you roll in, catch up on Slack, email, system status, and important metrics.

10:00 am — you participate in our daily stand up, sharing what you did yesterday, what you plan on doing today, and if there are any roadblocks.

10:15 am — you dig into building our newest platform feature, validating the problem it will solve and designing inputs and outputs.

12:00 pm — you hit an awesome take out place in Uptown Waterloo and chow with the team.

1:00 pm — you put on the headphones and get dialed in to build that feature.

3:30 pm — happy with the code, you deploy to dev and if tests pass, staging.

4:00 pm — you attend a design session for a new feature, contributing thoughts, opinions, and experience to the discussion.

5:00 pm — you wrap up unit tests, prep for deploy tomorrow, and pack up for the day.

 A FEW MORE THINGS TO KNOW

We offer a great compensation package including a competitive base salary, stock options and a comprehensive benefits plan for you, and your family.

We have flexible work hours and flexible remote working options.

New employees receive 3 weeks of paid vacation minimum each year.

Our HQ is in Uptown Waterloo, at the Communitech Data Hub. We are surrounded by other awesome startups focused on data, AI, machine learning, and IOT, as well in the middle of tons of events and visits from somewhat important people.

We have weekly lunches, “Ride or Pie” Fridays, and snacks to keep everyone fueled.

We “Hack the Sky” (our internal hackathon), teaming up with our peers for 36 hours to build something awesome that doesn’t pertain to our normal day to day work.

Leave your ego at the door. If you are smart but mean or arrogant, this isn’t the place for you.
